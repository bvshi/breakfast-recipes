    <p>Here is the recipe for perfect scrambled eggs - soft, moist and delicious</p>
    <p><em>Recipe by: me :)</em></p>

    <h2><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h2>
<div class = "center">
    <ul>
        <li> 2 large eggs</li>
        <li> 20g of cold butter</li>
        <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><strong>Instructions:</strong></h2>
<ol>
    <li>Put a knob of butter on the pan and turn on the stove on medium heat</li>
    <li>In a small bowl whisk the eggs and add salt and pepper</li>
    <li>After the butter is melted on the pan, put your eggs along with the garlic</li>
    <li>Using a spatula keep whisking the eggs - it will keep the eggs moist and create a perfect texture. When you see that the eggs are starting to stick to the pan, take the pan off the heat and keep whisking</li>
    <li>After a minute put the pan back on the stove and keep repeating this process. You can add some more butter in the meantime</li>
    <li>When you see that the eggs created a texture of your liking, you can stop whisking and you are ready to serve. You can garnish with more salt and pepper. <em>Voila!</em></li>
</ol>
